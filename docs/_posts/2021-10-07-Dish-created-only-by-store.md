As discussed in another note, we would like to enforce
the fact, that only store can create a Dish. Unfortunately it seems, that
we cannot really acheive it with only Dish design (i.e. with the design
of well-fed-cat-core-components). This can only be enforced by
the implementation of a particular store. And because core-components do
not controll implementation of particular stores, we can only articulate
in the documentation conventions, which have to be maintained by
store implementation fot he system to work properly.
